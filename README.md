# Haskell experiments

### All my one-file-one-off haskell math projects
```bisect.hs``` approximate value of $f(x) = g(x)$ in range $(a, b)$ to $\varepsilon$ precision

~~```num_integration.hs```~~ approximate area between $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ in range $(a, b)$ to $\varepsilon$ precision

### Compilation
```> ghc ./{project}.hs```

### Goals
Learn purely functional programming to later apply concepts from it in other projects.
